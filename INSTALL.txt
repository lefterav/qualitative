* python 2.7
* orange ml toolkit
* py4j
* python-nltk
* xmlrpclib
* numpy
* scipy
* suds
* ruffus [only for training]
* expsuite [only for training]

external programs [need to start separately]
* lmserver wrapped over SRILM
* Acrolinx IQ [optional]

jar files:
* Berkeley parser
* Meteor
* Language tool [optional] 

other resources:
* language model for source and target language (ARPA format)
* trained grammar for Berkeley parser (source and target language)



Orange ML toolkit
--------------------
sudo apt-get install python-dev g++ build-essential python-pip 
sudo pip install --upgrade pip  
sudo pip install orange

* There is also a debian package / repository called orangesvn ( sudo apt-get install orangesvn) but works only with python 2.5. If you use it, you may have to tackle pythonpath issues

No root access:
- Go to http://orange.biolab.si/ and download packed sources
- python setup.py install --user



Other platforms


Use the standard way to install pip at your operating system or get pip from here: 
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

pip install orange


Various other libraries
-------
sudo apt-get install python-nltk (in Ubuntu 10.04 or later) otherwise try with pip  

	sudo apt-get install libyaml-dev
	sudo pip install nltk

sudo apt-get remove python-numpy python-scipy (repositories provide only old versions)
sudo apt-get install python python-dev gcc gfortran g++ libblas-dev libatlas-cpp-0.6-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev libsuitesparse-dev   
sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install scipy 



ruffus :
----------

Ruffus is a pipeline execution framework for Python, that is used for the preprocessing of the data in scripts such as src/exexperiment/autoranking/annotate_updated. If you already have annotated data you can skip this

Ruffus can be installed also by using pip install. If you have problems check the following:

wget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/11726755/pypy-lib_1.0.0-svn51091-1_all.deb
wget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pypy/1.0.0-svn51091-1/+build/503581/+files/pypy_1.0.0-svn51091-1_amd64.deb
wget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pypy/1.0.0-svn51091-1/+build/503581/+files/pypy-stackless_1.0.0-svn51091-1_amd64.deb
dpkg -i 


Python ExpSuite
---------------
Expsuite is a set of scripts that parallelizes the training of a big numbers of systems, with various parameters, and allows monitoring the results. Please check out the latest version of expsuite and add it to the python path
